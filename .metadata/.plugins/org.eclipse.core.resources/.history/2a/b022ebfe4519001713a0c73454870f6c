text ="""       You can see here how there are these numbers on the left, 0,1,2,3,4,5 and so on, like line numbers. 
   These numbers are actually your "index." The index of a dataframe is what the data is related by, 
            ordered by...etc. Generally, it is going to be the variable that connects all of the data. 
            In this case, we never defined anything for this purpose, and it would be a challenge for Pandas 
            to just somehow "know" what that variable was. Thus, when you do not define an index, 
            Pandas will just make one for you like this. Looking at the data set right now, 
            do you see a column that connects the others?

            The "Day" column fits that bill! Generally, if you have any dated data, the date will be the 
            "index" as this is how all of the data points relate. There are many ways to identify the index, 
            change the index, and so on. We'll cover a couple here. First, on any existing dataframe, 
            we can set a new index like so: """
